CMake Error at CMakeLists.txt:26 (find_package):
  By not providing "Findcmr_msgs.cmake" in CMAKE_MODULE_PATH this project has
  asked CMake to find a package configuration file provided by "cmr_msgs",
  but CMake did not find one.

  Could not find a package configuration file provided by "cmr_msgs" with any
  of the following names:

    cmr_msgsConfig.cmake
    cmr_msgs-config.cmake

  Add the installation prefix of "cmr_msgs" to CMAKE_PREFIX_PATH or set
  "cmr_msgs_DIR" to a directory containing one of the above files.  If
  "cmr_msgs" provides a separate development package or SDK, be sure it has
  been installed.
